Folk seem to have been just landed in [adventures], usually — their paths were laid that way.
But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn’t.
And if they had, we shouldn’t know, because they’d have been forgotten.

It is not our part to master all the tides of the world,
but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set,
uprooting the evil in the fields that we know,
so that those who live after may have clean earth to till.
What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.

Mordor.
The one place in Middle-Earth we don’t want to see any closer.
And it’s the one place we’re trying to get to.
It’s just where we can’t get.
Let’s face it, Mr. Frodo, we’re lost.

The board is set, the pieces are moving.
